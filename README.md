# BookMyShow
A movie seat booking web app that connects to The Movie Database API and populates a selection of movies currently in theatres. It allows the user to select a movie and reserve seats while displaying the total number of tickets and the total price for the tickets. The seat selection is also stored in local storage.(This is more of an attempt at a front-end experience rather than having a backend connected to store the seat selection.) When the user clicks pay, they are redirectly to a static confirmation page.
